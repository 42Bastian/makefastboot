PC version of Atari Jaguar cartridge signing tools - original source from AtariHQ.
Updated to allow substitution of the boot code with something user-provided
('Tursi' mode). In this mode, the MD5 hash is no longer stored in the encrypted header, allowing that space to be used for code.

Note that the public and private keys are now embedded in the program. The files are here for reference only.
